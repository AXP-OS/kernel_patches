Subject: [PATCH] jbd2: don't mark block as modified if the handle is out of
 credits

commit e09463f220ca9a1a1ecfda84fcda658f99a1f12a upstream.

Do not set the b_modified flag in block's journal head should not
until after we're sure that jbd2_journal_dirty_metadat() will not
abort with an error due to there not being enough space reserved in
the jbd2 handle.

Otherwise, future attempts to modify the buffer may lead a large
number of spurious errors and warnings.

This addresses CVE-2018-10883.
