Subject: x86/speculation/l1tf: Invert all not present mappings

commit f22cc87f6c1f771b57c407555cfefd811cdd9507 upstream

For kernel mappings PAGE_PROTNONE is not necessarily set for a non present
mapping, but the inversion logic explicitely checks for !PRESENT and
PROT_NONE.

Remove the PROT_NONE check and make the inversion unconditional for all not
present mappings.
