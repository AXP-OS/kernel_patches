Subject: KVM: arm64: Allow SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_3 to be discovered and
 migrated

commit a5905d6af492ee6a4a2205f0d550b3f931b03d03 upstream.

KVM allows the guest to discover whether the ARCH_WORKAROUND SMCCC are
implemented, and to preserve that state during migration through its
firmware register interface.

Add the necessary boiler plate for SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_3.
