Subject: x86/entry: Remove skip_r11rcx

commit 1b331eeea7b8676fc5dbdf80d0a07e41be226177 upstream.

Yes, r11 and rcx have been restored previously, but since they're being
popped anyway (into rsi) might as well pop them into their own regs --
setting them to the value they already are.

Less magical code.
