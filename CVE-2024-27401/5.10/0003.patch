Subject: firewire: nosy: ensure user_length is taken into account when
 fetching packet contents

commit 38762a0763c10c24a4915feee722d7aa6e73eb98 upstream.

Ensure that packet_buffer_get respects the user_length provided. If
the length of the head packet exceeds the user_length, packet_buffer_get
will now return 0 to signify to the user that no data were read
and a larger buffer size is required. Helps prevent user space overflows.
