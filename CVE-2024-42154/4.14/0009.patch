Subject: tcp_metrics: validate source addr length

[ Upstream commit 66be40e622e177316ae81717aa30057ba9e61dff ]

I don't see anything checking that TCP_METRICS_ATTR_SADDR_IPV4
is at least 4 bytes long, and the policy doesn't have an entry
for this attribute at all (neither does it for IPv6 but v6 is
manually validated).
