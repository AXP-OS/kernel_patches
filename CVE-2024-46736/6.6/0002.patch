Subject: smb: client: fix double put of @cfile in smb2_rename_path()

[ Upstream commit 3523a3df03c6f04f7ea9c2e7050102657e331a4f ]

If smb2_set_path_attr() is called with a valid @cfile and returned
-EINVAL, we need to call cifs_get_writable_path() again as the
reference of @cfile was already dropped by previous smb2_compound_op()
call.

Fixes: 71f15c90e785 ("smb: client: retry compound request without reusing lease")
