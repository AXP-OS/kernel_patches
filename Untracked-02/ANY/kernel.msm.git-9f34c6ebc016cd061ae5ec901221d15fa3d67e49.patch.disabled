Subject: [PATCH] msm: msm_bus: Explicitly clear client requests before
 removal

Clients can potentially leave non-zero requests before
unregistering. Such requests persist and cause instability
and severe power and performance impact.

Protect the system against such clients by explicitly
clearing the client requests before unregistration.
